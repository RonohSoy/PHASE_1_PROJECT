# AIRCRAFTS FOR COMMERCIAL AND PRIVATE ENTERPRISES PROJECT
## Project Aim
The main objective of this data analysis project is to determine the lowest risk aircraft to purchase.

### Data Source and Data Exploration
This data comes from Kaggle competition ( datasetLinks to an external site) from the National 
Transportation Safety Board that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents
and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.

### Methodology
The analysis will involve descriptive statistics and data visualization.

### Expected Outcome of This Data Analysis Project
The expected outcome of this analysis is to identify the lowest risk aircraft to purchase, based on a comprehensive evaluation of the key factors that contribute to risk, and to provide recommendations for buyers seeking to minimize their risk exposure.

### Reproducibility
To reproduce the analysis, the following dependencies are required: Python 3.12, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.
The analysis can be run by executing the `analysis.py` script in the repository.

### Limitations
The analysis has limitations, including the reliance on historical data and the potential for biases in the dataset.

### Future Directions
Future directions for the analysis include incorporating real-time data and exploring the use of more advanced machine learning algorithms.
